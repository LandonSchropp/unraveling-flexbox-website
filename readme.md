# Unraveling Flexbox

This repo contains the source code for the website for my book Unraveling Flexbox. This is an older
Rails site that was switched over to a static site. It's missing many of my normal coding
conventions, but if it ain't broke...

This application has a few Yarn tasks.

* `yarn build`: Compiles the website's source into the `build` directory.
* `yarn serve`: Starts a development server for the site.
* `yarn deploy`: Deploys the static site to GitHub Pages.
